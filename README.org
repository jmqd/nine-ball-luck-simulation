#+title: Nine Ball Luck Simulation

This repository simulates and explores the effects of luck on winning
percentages in Nine Ball, comparing and contrasting different rule sets to see
the effect the rule set has on those luck effects.

See [[https://jm.dev/amplifying-returns-of-luck-in-apa-nine-ball][The Amplifying Returns Of Luck In APA Nine Ball]] for a writeup on these
simulations and the data.
